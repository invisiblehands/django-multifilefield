# django-multifilefield

### A pluggable django html5 filefield for multiple files

Basically this allows you to easily throw in a nice html5 input for uploading and clearing multiple fields.  You can easily add in a queryset or list of files and it will handle the file procesing.  There are validators for required, amount of files (min/max) and total uploaded.  

### Requirements

- django >= 1.6
- django-floppyforms>=1.1.1
