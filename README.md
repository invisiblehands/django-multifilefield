### A pluggable django html5 filefield for multiple files

Easily add a nice html5 input to your django form for uploading and clearing multiple fields.  Initialize it with a queryset or list of files and it will also handle the file procesing.  There are validators for required, amount of files (min/max) and total uploaded.
